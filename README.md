# Prediction breeding
Present and discuss the following topics: genetic and genotypic values, genetic control, the covariance between individuals, response to selection, population structure and genetics, mating designs, genotype x environment, selection indices, genomic selection, and association mapping, and stochastic simulations to compare breeding schemes.

The dataset used as an example is an unbalanced partial diallel between two groups of 7 maize lines.
One group is good for P and another for N.
So, 14 lines + 41 single crosses were evaluated in 2 levels of N, following an RCBD with two reps.
Traits: SDM - shoot dry mass; NAE - nitrogen acquisition efficiency; SRA - specific root area.
Genotyping: SNPs - 600K Affymetrix maize array
